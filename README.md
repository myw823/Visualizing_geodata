# Visualizing_geodata
This is my coursework from the Python for Everybody specialization - 4: Using Database with Python

Retrieving name from local file Then visualize it on Google map and Create a database to store the address data

1. run geoload.py
local .data file (name)-> post to web services (get full address)-> Create .sqlite database

2. run geodump.py
local .sqlite database -> write json file -> .html file
